A simple web app to detect hand raised in webcam video.  

libary used: https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/  

handtrack.js provide hand detection (bounding box) in the web page.  

As I'm more interested in the implementation of deep learning application, I decided to go with this libary.
